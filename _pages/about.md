# About Me
I am a BK Research Fellow at Seoul National University. Previously, I was a Limited Term Assistant Professor at the University of Georgia. I received my Ph.D. in Mathematics at MIT in June 2021, under the supervision of [Bjorn Poonen](http://www-math.mit.edu/~poonen/). My interests lie in algebraic geometry and number theory.
