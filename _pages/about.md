# About Me
I am a Limited Term Assistant Professor at the University of Georgia. My work is currently supported by the [AMS-Simons Travel Grants](https://www.ams.org/programs/travel-grants/AMS-SimonsTG/recipients). I received my Ph.D. in Mathematics at MIT in June 2021, under the supervision of [Bjorn Poonen](http://www-math.mit.edu/~poonen/). My interests lie in algebraic geometry and number theory.
